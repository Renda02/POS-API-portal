Our API utilizes OAuth 2.0 authorization framework for secure authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific resources and perform actions based on their roles and permissions.

## Authorization

To interact with our API, you need to authenticate your user account and use an access token. All API requests require a valid JWT token to authorize access to protected resources.

### **Creating an account**

Before you can authenticate and request an access token, you must first create a user account. This is done by sending a `POST/users` endpoint.

**Request example**:

```json
{
  "username": "user@example.com",
  "password": "your_password"
}
```

**Response example**:

```json
{
  "id": "674d0bf5c28b69001f8e03a1",
  "created_at": "2024-04-22T10:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2024-04-22T10:00:00Z",
  "user_name": "john_doe",
  "email": "johndoe@gmail.com",
  "password": "P@ssw0rd!",
  "role": "manager"
}
```

### 2. **Obtaining an Access Token**

Once your account is created, you can authenticate the user and obtain an access token. This is done by sending a `POST/auth/token` endpoint.

**Request example:**

```json
{
  "username": "user@example.com",
  "password": "your_password"
}
```

**Response example**:

```json
{
  "auth_id": "674d0bf5c28b69001f8e03a1",
  "created_at": "2024-04-22T10:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2024-04-22T10:00:00Z",
  "access_token": "fa0b97b2-445f-41d2-b50f-fb3b014a301e",
  "expires_at": "2024-04-22T10:00:00Z",
  "refresh_token": "d1a3e281-96b6-4f77-a587-7b6c8c2a96d9",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "user_name": "john_doe"
}
```

Once you have the access token, include it in the `Authorization` header of every request to access protected resources.

### **Error Handling**

**401 Unauthorized**

Ensure the **Authorization** header is included in your request.
If the header is present, verify that the access token is correct.
