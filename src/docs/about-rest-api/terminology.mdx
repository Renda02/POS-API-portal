This guide provides definitions for key terms used throughout the POS API documentation.

## API terminology

| **Term** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Authentication** | The process of verifying the identity of a user, application, or system to ensure they are who they claim to be. Typically, this involves using credentials like usernames and passwords, or tokens. |
| **Authorization** | The process of determining what an authenticated user, application, or system is allowed to do. This defines the permissions and access rights granted to the authenticated entity. |
| **API consumer** | A system, application, or service that makes requests to and consumes data from an API. The consumer interacts with the API endpoints to retrieve or send data. |
| **API producer** | The system, application, or service that provides an API, exposing data or functionality that API consumers can access. The producer implements the API's endpoints. |
| **API client** | A specific type of API consumer, typically an application or tool, that communicates directly with an API to make requests and receive responses. |
| **Access token** | A credential that an application uses to authenticate and authorize requests on behalf of a user or service. It typically has a limited lifespan and grants access to specific resources or actions. |
| **Refresh token** | A credential that can be used to obtain a new access token after the original access token expires. It allows applications to maintain user sessions without requiring repeated logins. |
| **Client ID** | A unique identifier assigned to a client (application or service) when registering with an API provider. It is used to track and manage access requests from the client. |
| **Client secret** | A confidential piece of information associated with a client ID, used to authenticate the client with the API provider. It should never be shared publicly. |
| **REST (Representational State Transfer)** | An architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on stateless communication and uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources, which are represented by URLs. |

## Business domain terminology

| **Term** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Patron** | A person who uses or supports a service, business, or establishment. In the context of a facility, a patron is an individual who visits or makes use of the offered services. |
| **Staff** | The group of employees or personnel working at a specific location or organization. They are responsible for providing services or carrying out operational tasks. |
| **Admin** | Short for "administrator," it refers to a person with elevated permissions who manages and oversees systems, services, or operations. Admins can configure settings and grant access. |
| **ResTech** | Short for "Reservation Technology," it refers to software or systems that help manage, process, and track reservations for services or events. It enables efficient booking management. |
