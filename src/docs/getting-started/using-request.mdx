After sending a request, the API returns a HTTPS status code that indicates the outcome of the request:

- **200 OK**: The request was successful.
- **201 Created**: A new resource was successfully created.
- **400 Bad Request**: The request was invalid (e.g., missing required fields).
- **401 Unauthorized**: The access token is missing or invalid.
- **403 Forbidden**: The user does not have permission.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: A server issue occurred.

For more details, refer to [MDN HTTP response status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).

## Response Headers

Response headers convey information about the API response. View them in Postman under the Headers tab in the Response panel. Some key headers include:

- **Content-Type**: Specifies the format of the response body (e.g., `application/json`).
- **Authorization**: Contains authentication information when applicable.
- **Location**: Points to the URL of a newly created resource.

Refer to the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) for details on HTTP headers.

## About the Response Body

For requests that return a response body, the data is typically formatted in JSON. The response body may include:

- **ID**: Unique identifiers for created resources.
- **Links**: URLs pointing to additional resources.
- **Timestamps**: Indicating when a resource was created or updated.
- **Null values**: Optional fields may return `null` if not set.

## Pagination

The API supports pagination for endpoints that return lists of resources. You can use the following query parameters:

- **`limit`**: The number of items to return per page (maximum: 30).
- **`offset`**: The number of items to skip before starting to return results.

### Example Request

```json
GET/orders?limit=10&offset=20
Authorization: Bearer your_access_token
```

## Response
```json
{
  "results": [
    { "id": "1", "name": "Order 1" },
    { "id": "2", "name": "Order 2" }
  ],
  "total_results": 100,
  "limit": 10,
  "offset": 0
}
```

Use query parameters such as `limit` and `offset` to navigate paginated results effectively.
