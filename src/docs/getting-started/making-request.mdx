After you have authenticated to the API, you can send requests to the API. The base URL for all endpoints is:

 `http://localhost:80/` 

## Authentication

Most API requests require authentication. Follow these steps:

1. Register a user by sending a `POST /users` request with:

```
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePass123!",
  "role": "patron",
  "user_name": "user123"
}
```

1. Obtain an access token using `POST /auth/token`:

```
{
  "grant_type": "password",
  "user_name": "user123",
  "password": "SecurePass123!"
}
```

1. The response includes an `access_token`. Use it in the `Authorization` header for future requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

## Making a Request

After you have authenticated to the API, you can send requests to the API. The base URL for all endpoints is:

Include the `Authorization` header when making authenticated requests.

### Example: Create an Order

```yaml
curl -X POST "http://localhost:80/orders" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "name": "Benjamin",
       "table_number": 18,
       "dish_ids": ["66e6a90a5eb1ced30f93c32a", "66e6a90a5eb1ced30f93c31e"],
       "special_requests": "No peanuts"
     }'
```

### Handling API Responses

- **201 Created**: The request was successful, and a new resource was created.
- **400 Bad Request**: The request was invalid (e.g., missing required fields).
- **401 Unauthorized**: The access token is missing or invalid.
- **403 Forbidden**: The user does not have permission.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: A server issue occurred.
- 

Following these steps ensures secure and efficient interaction with the POS REST API.
