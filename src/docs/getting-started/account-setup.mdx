The **Account Setup** section provides a comprehensive guide for users to create an account and obtain the necessary API credentials.

To begin using the API, you’ll need to sign up for an account, which involves
creating a username and password. To create an account:

1. Go to to the API registration page.
2. Click on the **Sign Up** button. Fill in the required fields, including your email address, desired username, and password.
3. Accept the terms and conditions and click **Submit**. A verification link is sent to your email.
4. Check your email for a verification link and follow the instructions to activate your account.

After successfully signing up and verifying your account, you can access the API portal to manage your settings and create applications.

**Accessing the API Portal** 

To access the portal:

1.  Go to the API portal login page.
2. Enter your registered username and password.
3. Click on the **Login** button. You will be directed to the API dashboard where you can view your account details and manage your apps.

**Creating an App to obtain client credentials**

To obtain an access token, you'll need to create an app in the user interface. This
process generates a `client_id` and `client_secret` , which you will use to request an access_token that expires in 30 minutes and can be refreshed.

**Steps to Get Client Credentials:**

1.  Click on **Apps** in the dashboard.
2. From the **Apps** dashboard, select **Create App**.
3. Enter a name for your application (e.g., “Food Ordering Appˮ).
4. After creation, your `client_id` and `client_secret` will be displayed.

Once you have these credentials, you can proceed to use the API by exchanging
them for an access token.
